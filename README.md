# Split a list in Python

Usually I have the need to split some lists in Python. 
Because there is not a method to do this, I wrote a code to solve this iussue.

I wrote a method of a list's subclass. I called this method split_list. 
For instance, if I have a huge amount of elements in this list, I can split this list in n sub-lists. 
I must write the number of chunks as argument of method. The method returns a list containing the asked chunks.
